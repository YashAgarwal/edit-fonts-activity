##Character Map Class
This class makes a character map of the specified font
the following are the ways to use it

#Multi Row Scroll Type Navigation

you can use it like this `#CharacterMap = characterMap(font, 15, 10, 'SCROLL')` where `15` is the number of **Columns** and the number of **Rows** is ignored and all the available vertical space is given to the widget
